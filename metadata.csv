0,augustusGene,AUGUSTUS,AUGUSTUS ab initio gene predictions v3.1,"<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  This track shows <i>ab initio</i> predictions from the program
  <a href=""http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/"" target=""_blank"">AUGUSTUS</a> (version 3.1).
  The predictions are based on the genome sequence alone.
</p>

<p>
For more information on the different gene tracks, see our <a target=_blank 
href=""/FAQ/FAQgenes.html"">Genes FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Statistical signal models were built for splice sites, branch-point
patterns, translation start sites, and the poly-A signal.
Furthermore, models were built for the sequence content of
protein-coding and non-coding regions as well as for the length distributions
of different exon and intron types. Detailed descriptions of most of these different models
can be found in Mario Stanke's
<a href=""http://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/handle/11858/00-1735-0000-0006-B3F8-4"" target=""_blank"">dissertation</a>.
This track shows the most likely gene structure according to a
Semi-Markov Conditional Random Field model.
Alternative splicing transcripts were obtained with
a sampling algorithm (<tt>--alternatives-from-sampling=true --sample=100 --minexonintronprob=0.2
--minmeanexonintronprob=0.5 --maxtracks=3 --temperature=2</tt>).
</p>

<p>
The different models used by Augustus were trained on a number of different species-specific
gene sets, which included 1000-2000 training gene structures. The <tt>--species</tt> option allows
one to choose the species used for training the models. Different training species were used
for the <tt>--species</tt> option when generating these predictions for different groups of
assemblies.

<p>
This track shows human clinically relevant variants from the 
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/"" target=""_blank"">ClinVar database</a>,
mapped from hg38 to the rn6 genome. The mapping uses UCSC's whole-genome alignments and the 
tool <a href=""https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver"" target=_blank>LiftOver</a>. 
The annotations are somewhat speculative, 
as LiftOver is not meant to be used for cross-organism mapping. Among others, 
LiftOver has no notion of phylogenetic trees or protein orthology, so the 
exact protein to which they are mapped may not be the annotated ortholog.
In areas with protein repeats it may have been mapped to the wrong exon. When the 
genome nucleotide in rn6 is different from hg38, the corresponding position 
could be several basepairs away. Generally, the more different the gene, the harder the
mapping. Before planning assays on these data, a manual alignment and annotation 
of the human and rn6 nucleotide or amino acid sequences is recommended.


<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of ClinVar variants are labeled with the human ClinVar variant
descriptions. For example, the label ""C&gt;G"" usually means that in human, the cDNA 
nucleotide change is from C&gt;T. On a transcript on the reverse strand, the human
genome nucleotide on the forward strand would be G. In rn6, the genome may not
be G at this position. Zoom in to see the nucleotide in rn6, or click the
variant to show the human position and nucleotide and the rn6 nucleotide.</p>

<p>All ClinVar information related to each is variant is shown on that
variant's details page.  Hold the mouse over a feature
to show the clinical significance of a variant in humans.
</p>

<p>Only short variants with a length &lt; 10 bp on the human genome were
lifted. A few variants that after lifting result in rn6 annotations longer than
30bp were filtered out, too. This can happen in repetitive regions that are
hard to align.</p>

<p>
Annotations are shaded by clinical annotation:
<b><font color=""red"">red for pathogenic</font></b>,
<B><font color=""#888"">dark grey for uncertain significance or not provided</font></b> and
<B><font color=""green"">green for benign</font></b>.
</p>

<p>
The score of the variants is the number of ""stars"" in ClinVar. On the track configuration 
page (above), you can filter the track to show only variants with more than a certain 
number of stars. For more information on the star rating, see the 
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_status/""
target=""_blank"">ClinVar documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Data updates</h2>
ClinVar is updated every month, but these mappings are not updated yet on a regular schedule.
Please contact us if you are interested in regular updates.

<H2>Data access</H2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the 
<a href=""../cgi-bin/hgTables"">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href=""../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator"">Data Integrator</a>.

<p>
For automated download and analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that
can be downloaded from
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/rn6/bbi/"" target=""_blank"">our download server</a>.
The files for this track are called <tt>clinvarLift.bb</tt>. Individual
regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"">here</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, e.g. 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/rn6/bbi/clinvarLift.bb -chrom=chr1 -start=0 -end=100000000 stdout</tt></p>
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The hg38 ClinvarMain track was annotated with nucleotides and positions, lifted to rn6,
filtered again for variants &lt; 30bp
and annotated with nucleotides again. The output was converted to the 
<a href=""../goldenPath/help/bigBed.html"">bigBed</a> format.
The program that performs the mapping is available on
<a href=""https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/utils/doClinvarLift""

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are a key part of many
large-scale sequencing projects.  A BAC typically consists of 50 - 300 kb of
DNA.  During the early phase of a sequencing project, it is common
to sequence a single read (approximately 500 bases) off each end of
a large number of BACs.  Later on in the project, these BAC end reads
can be mapped to the genome sequence.</P>
<P>
These BAC end pairs can be useful for validating the assembly over
relatively long ranges.  In some cases, the BACs are useful biological
reagents.  This track can also be used for determining which BAC
contains a given gene, useful information for certain wet lab experiments.</P>
<P>
The scoring scheme used for this annotation assigns 1000 to an alignment
when the BAC end pair aligns to only one location in the genome (after
filtering).  When a BAC end pair or clone aligns to multiple locations, the
score is calculated as 1500/(number of alignments).</P>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows multiple alignments of 20 species
and measurements of evolutionary conservation using
two methods (<em>phastCons</em> and <em>phyloP</em>) from the
<a href=""http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/"" target=_blank>
PHAST package</a>, for all 20 species.
The multiple alignments were generated using multiz and 
other tools in the UCSC/<a href=""http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/"" 
target=_blank>Penn State Bioinformatics</a>
comparative genomics alignment pipeline.
Conserved elements identified by phastCons are also displayed in
this track.
</p>
<p>
PhastCons is a hidden Markov model-based method that estimates the probability that each
nucleotide belongs to a conserved element, based on the multiple alignment.
It considers not just each individual alignment column, but also its
flanking columns.  By contrast, phyloP separately measures conservation at
individual columns, ignoring the effects of their neighbors.  As a
consequence, the phyloP plots have a less smooth appearance than the
phastCons plots, with more &quot;texture&quot; at individual sites.  The two methods
have different strengths and weaknesses.  PhastCons is sensitive to &quot;runs&quot;
of conserved sites, and is therefore effective for picking out conserved
elements.  PhyloP, on the other hand, is more appropriate for evaluating
signatures of selection at particular nucleotides or classes of nucleotides
(e.g., third codon positions, or first positions of miRNA target sites).
</p>
<p>
Another important difference is that phyloP can measure acceleration
(faster evolution than expected under neutral drift) as well as
conservation (slower than expected evolution).  In the phyloP plots, sites
predicted to be conserved are assigned positive scores (and shown in blue),
while sites predicted to be fast-evolving are assigned negative scores (and
shown in red).  The absolute values of the scores represent -log p-values
under a null hypothesis of neutral evolution.  The phastCons scores, by
contrast, represent probabilities of negative selection and range between 0
and 1.
</p>
<p>
Both phastCons and phyloP treat alignment gaps and unaligned nucleotides as
missing data, and both were run with the same parameters.
</p>

<p>
UCSC has repeatmasked and aligned all genome assemblies, and
provides all the sequences for download.  For genome assemblies
not available in the genome browser, there are alternative browser
views in the <em>preview</em> genome browser.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
In full and pack display modes, conservation scores are displayed as a
<em>wiggle track</em> (histogram) in which the height reflects the 
size of the score. 
The conservation wiggles can be configured in a variety of ways to 
highlight different aspects of the displayed information. 
Click the <a href=""../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html"" 
target=_blank>Graph configuration help</a> link for an explanation 
of the configuration options.</p>
<p>
Pairwise alignments of each species to the rat genome are 
displayed below the conservation histogram as a grayscale density plot (in 
pack mode) or as a wiggle (in full mode) that indicates alignment quality.
In dense display mode, conservation is shown in grayscale using
darker values to indicate higher levels of overall conservation 
as scored by phastCons. </p>
<p>
Checkboxes on the track configuration page allow selection of the
species to include in the pairwise display.  
Note that excluding species from the pairwise display does not alter the
the conservation score display.</p>
<p>
To view detailed information about the alignments at a specific
position, zoom the display in to 30,000 or fewer bases, then click on
the alignment.</p>

<h3>Gap Annotation</h3>
<p>
The <em>Display chains between alignments</em> configuration option 
enables display of gaps between alignment blocks in the pairwise alignments in 
a manner similar to the Chain track display.  The following
conventions are used:
<ul>
<li><b>Single line:</b> No bases in the aligned species. Possibly due to a
lineage-specific insertion between the aligned blocks in the rat genome
or a lineage-specific deletion between the aligned blocks in the aligning
species.
<li><b>Double line:</b> Aligning species has one or more unalignable bases in
the gap region. Possibly due to excessive evolutionary distance between 
species or independent indels in the region between the aligned blocks in both
species. 
<li><b>Pale yellow coloring:</b> Aligning species has Ns in the gap region.
Reflects uncertainty in the relationship between the DNA of both species, due
to lack of sequence in relevant portions of the aligning species. 
</ul></p>

<h3>Genomic Breaks</h3>
<p>
Discontinuities in the genomic context (chromosome, scaffold or region) of the
aligned DNA in the aligning species are shown as follows: 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Vertical blue bar:</b> Represents a discontinuity that persists indefinitely
on either side, <em>e.g.</em> a large region of DNA on either side of the bar
comes from a different chromosome in the aligned species due to a large scale
rearrangement. 
<li>
<b>Green square brackets:</b> Enclose shorter alignments consisting of DNA from
one genomic context in the aligned species nested inside a larger chain of
alignments from a different genomic context. The alignment within the
brackets may represent a short misalignment, a lineage-specific insertion of a
transposon in the rat genome that aligns to a paralogous copy somewhere
else in the aligned species, or other similar occurrence.
</ul></p>

<h3>Base Level</h3>
<p>
When zoomed-in to the base-level display, the track shows the base 
composition of each alignment. 
The numbers and symbols on the Gaps
line indicate the lengths of gaps in the rat sequence at those 
alignment positions relative to the longest non-rat sequence. 
If there is sufficient space in the display, the size of the gap is shown. 
If the space is insufficient and the gap size is a multiple of 3, a 
&quot;*&quot; is displayed; other gap sizes are indicated by &quot;+&quot;.</p>
<p>
Codon translation is available in base-level display mode if the
displayed region is identified as a coding segment. To display this annotation,
select the species for translation from the pull-down menu in the Codon
Translation configuration section at the top of the page. Then, select one of
the following modes:
<ul>
<li> 
<b>No codon translation:</b> The gene annotation is not used; the bases are
displayed without translation. 
<li>
<b>Use default species reading frames for translation:</b> The annotations from the genome
displayed 
in the <em>Default species to establish reading frame</em> pull-down menu are used to
translate all the aligned species present in the alignment. 
<li>
<b>Use reading frames for species if available, otherwise no translation:</b> Codon
translation is performed only for those species where the region is
annotated as protein coding.
<li><b>Use reading frames for species if available, otherwise use default species:</b>
Codon translation is done on those species that are annotated as being protein
coding over the aligned region using species-specific annotation; the remaining
species are translated using the default species annotation. 
</ul></p>
<p>
Codon translation uses the following gene tracks as the basis for
translation, depending on the species chosen (<b>Table 2</b>).  
Species listed in the row labeled &quot;None&quot; do not have 
species-specific reading frames for gene translation.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p> 
Pairwise alignments with the Rat genome were generated for 
each species using lastz from repeat-masked genomic sequence. 
Pairwise alignments were then linked into chains using a dynamic programming
algorithm that finds maximally scoring chains of gapless subsections
of the alignments organized in a kd-tree.
All pairwise alignment and chaining parameters are the same for all pairs.
See also: <a href=""http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Rn6_20-way_Genome_size_statistics""
target=_blank>rat 20-way alignment</a> parameters.
High-scoring chains were then placed along the genome, with
gaps filled by lower-scoring chains, to produce an alignment net.
For more information about the chaining and netting process and 
parameters for each species, see the description pages for the Chain and Net 
tracks.</p>
<p>
The resulting best-in-genome pairwise alignments
were progressively aligned using multiz/autoMZ, 
following the tree topology diagrammed above, to produce multiple alignments.
The multiple alignments were post-processed to
add annotations indicating alignment gaps, genomic breaks,
and base quality of the component sequences.
The annotated multiple alignments, in MAF format, are available for
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rn6/multiz20way/""
target=_blank>bulk download</a>.
An alignment summary table containing an entry for each
alignment block in each species was generated to improve
track display performance at large scales.
Framing tables were constructed to enable
visualization of codons in the multiple alignment display.</p>

<h3> Phylogenetic Tree Model</h3>
<p>
Both <em>phastCons</em> and <em>phyloP</em> are phylogenetic methods that
rely on a tree model containing the tree topology,
branch lengths representing evolutionary distance at neutrally
evolving sites, the background distribution of nucleotides, and a substitution
rate matrix.  The 
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rn6/phastCons20way/rn6.phastCons20way.mod""
target=_blank>rat tree model</a> for this track was
generated using the <em>phyloFit</em> program from the PHAST package  
(REV model, EM algorithm, medium precision) using multiple alignments of 
4-fold degenerate sites extracted from the 20-way alignment
(msa_view).  The 4d sites were derived from the NCBI RefSeq gene set
of Rat, filtered to select single-coverage long transcripts.
</p>
<h3> PhastCons Conservation </h3>
<p>
The phastCons program computes conservation scores based on a phylo-HMM, a
type of probabilistic model that describes both the process of DNA
substitution at each site in a genome and the way this process changes from
one site to the next (Felsenstein and Churchill 1996, Yang 1995, Siepel and
Haussler 2005).  PhastCons uses a two-state phylo-HMM, with a state for
conserved regions and a state for non-conserved regions.  The value plotted
at each site is the posterior probability that the corresponding alignment
column was &quot;generated&quot; by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM.  These
scores reflect the phylogeny (including branch lengths) of the species in
question, a continuous-time Markov model of the nucleotide substitution
process, and a tendency for conservation levels to be autocorrelated along
the genome (i.e., to be similar at adjacent sites).  The general reversible
(REV) substitution model was used.  Unlike many conservation-scoring programs, 
phastCons does not rely on a sliding window
of fixed size; therefore, short highly-conserved regions and long moderately
conserved regions can both obtain high scores.  
More information about
phastCons can be found in Siepel <em>et al</em>. 2005.</p> 
<p> 
The phastCons parameters were tuned to produce approximately 70% conserved
elements in the Rat NCBI RefSeq gene coding regions.
This parameter set (expected-length=45, target-coverage=0.3, rho=0.3) was
then used to generate the conservation scoring.</p>

<h3> PhyloP Conservation </h3>
<p>
The phyloP program supports several different methods for computing
p-values of conservation or acceleration, for individual nucleotides or
larger elements
(<a href=""http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/"" target=""_blank"">http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/</a>).
Here it was used
to produce separate scores at each base (--wig-scores option), considering
all branches of the phylogeny rather than a particular subtree or lineage
(i.e., the --subtree option was not used).  The scores were computed by
performing a likelihood ratio test at each alignment column (--method LRT),
and scores for both conservation and acceleration were produced (--mode
CONACC). 
</p>
<h3> Conserved Elements </h3>
<p>
The conserved elements were predicted by running phastCons with the
--most-conserved (aka --viterbi) option.  The predicted elements are
segments of the alignment
that are likely to have been &quot;generated&quot; by the conserved state of the
phylo-HMM. Each element is assigned a log-odds score equal to its log
probability under the conserved model minus its log probability under the
non-conserved model. The &quot;score&quot; field associated with this track contains
transformed log-odds scores, taking values between 0 and 1000. (The scores
are transformed using a monotonic function of the form a * log(x) + b.) The
raw log odds scores are retained in the &quot;name&quot; field and can be seen on the
details page or in the browser when the track's display mode is set to
&quot;pack&quot; or &quot;full&quot;.

<p>CpG islands are associated with genes, particularly housekeeping
genes, in vertebrates.  CpG islands are typically common near
transcription start sites and may be associated with promoter
regions.  Normally a C (cytosine) base followed immediately by a 
G (guanine) base (a CpG) is rare in
vertebrate DNA because the Cs in such an arrangement tend to be
methylated.  This methylation helps distinguish the newly synthesized
DNA strand from the parent strand, which aids in the final stages of
DNA proofreading after duplication.  However, over evolutionary time,
methylated Cs tend to turn into Ts because of spontaneous
deamination.  The result is that CpGs are relatively rare unless
there is selective pressure to keep them or a region is not methylated
for some other reason, perhaps having to do with the regulation of gene
expression.  CpG islands are regions where CpGs are present at
significantly higher levels than is typical for the genome as a whole.</p>

<p>
The unmasked version of the track displays potential CpG islands
that exist in repeat regions and would otherwise not be visible
in the repeat masked version.
</p>

<p>
By default, only the masked version of the track is displayed.  To view the
unmasked version, change the visibility settings in the track controls at
the top of this page.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>CpG islands were predicted by searching the sequence one base at a
time, scoring each dinucleotide (+17 for CG and -1 for others) and
identifying maximally scoring segments.  Each segment was then
evaluated for the following criteria:

<ul>
	<li>GC content of 50% or greater</li>
	<li>length greater than 200 bp</li>
	<li>ratio greater than 0.6 of observed number of CG dinucleotides to the expected number on the 
	basis of the number of Gs and Cs in the segment</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The entire genome sequence, masking areas included, was
used for the construction of the  track <em>Unmasked CpG</em>.
The track <em>CpG Islands</em> is constructed on the sequence after
all masked sequence is removed.
</p>

<p>The CpG count is the number of CG dinucleotides in the island.  
The Percentage CpG is the ratio of CpG nucleotide bases
(twice the CpG count) to the length.  The ratio of observed to expected 
CpG is calculated according to the formula (cited in 
Gardiner-Garden <em>et al</em>. (1987)):

<pre>    Obs/Exp CpG = Number of CpG * N / (Number of C * Number of G)</pre>

<p>
The unmasked version of the track displays potential CpG islands
that exist in repeat regions and would otherwise not be visible
in the repeat masked version.

<p>
By default, only the masked version of the track is displayed.  To view the
unmasked version, change the visibility settings in the track controls at
the top of this page.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>CpG islands were predicted by searching the sequence one base at a
time, scoring each dinucleotide (+17 for CG and -1 for others) and
identifying maximally scoring segments.  Each segment was then
evaluated for the following criteria:

<ul>
	<li>GC content of 50% or greater</li>
	<li>length greater than 200 bp</li>
	<li>ratio greater than 0.6 of observed number of CG dinucleotides to the expected number on the 
	basis of the number of Gs and Cs in the segment</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The entire genome sequence, masking areas included, was
used for the construction of the  track <em>Unmasked CpG</em>.
The track <em>CpG Islands</em> is constructed on the sequence after
all masked sequence is removed.
</p>

<p>The CpG count is the number of CG dinucleotides in the island.  
The Percentage CpG is the ratio of CpG nucleotide bases
(twice the CpG count) to the length.  The ratio of observed to expected 
CpG is calculated according to the formula (cited in 
Gardiner-Garden <em>et al</em>. (1987)):

<pre>    Obs/Exp CpG = Number of CpG * N / (Number of C * Number of G)</pre>

where N = length of sequence.</p>

40,est,Rat ESTs,Rat ESTs Including Unspliced,"<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alignments between rat expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/"" target=""_blank"">
GenBank</a> and the genome. ESTs are single-read sequences,
typically about 500 bases in length, that usually represent fragments of
transcribed genes.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
This track follows the display conventions for
<a href=""../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay"" target=""_blank"">
PSL alignment tracks</a>. In dense display mode, the items that
are more darkly shaded indicate matches of better quality.
</p>

<p>
The strand information (+/-) indicates the
direction of the match between the EST and the matching
genomic sequence.  It bears no relationship to the direction
of transcription of the RNA with which it might be associated.
</p>

<p>
The description page for this track has a filter that can be used to change
the display mode, alter the color, and include/exclude a subset of items
within the track. This may be helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task.
</p>

<p>
To use the filter:
<ol>
<li>Type a term in one or more of the text boxes to filter the EST
display. For example, to apply the filter to all ESTs expressed in a specific
organ, type the name of the organ in the tissue box. To view the list of
valid terms for each text box, consult the table in the Table Browser that
corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For example, the
&quot;tissue&quot; table contains all the types of tissues that can be
entered into the tissue text box. Multiple terms may be entered at once,
separated by a space. Wildcards may also be used in the filter.</li>
<li>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only ESTs that match all filter
criteria will be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, ESTs that
match any one of the filter criteria will be highlighted.</li>
<li>Choose the color or display characteristic that should be used to
highlight or include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is
chosen, the browser will not display ESTs that match the filter criteria.
If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser will display only those
ESTs that match the filter criteria.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
This track may also be configured to display base labeling, a feature that
allows the user to display all bases in the aligning sequence or only those
that differ from the genomic sequence. For more information about this option,
go to the
<a href=""../goldenPath/help/hgBaseLabel.html"" target=""_blank"">
Base Coloring for Alignment Tracks</a> page.
Several types of alignment gap may also be colored;

<a href=""../goldenPath/help/hgIndelDisplay.html"" target=""_blank"">
Alignment Insertion/Deletion Display Options</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
To make an EST, RNA is isolated from cells and reverse
transcribed into cDNA.  Typically, the cDNA is cloned
into a plasmid vector and a read is taken from the 5'
and/or 3' primer.  For most &mdash; but not all &mdash; ESTs, the
reverse transcription is primed by an oligo-dT, which
hybridizes with the poly-A tail of mature mRNA. The
reverse transcriptase may or may not make it to the 5'
end of the mRNA,  which may or may not be degraded.
</p>

<p>
In general, the 3' ESTs mark the end of transcription
reasonably well, but the 5' ESTs may end at any point
within the transcript.  Some of the newer cap-selected
libraries cover transcription start reasonably well. Before the
cap-selection techniques
emerged, some projects used random rather than poly-A
priming in an attempt to retrieve sequence distant from the
3' end.  These projects were successful at this, but as
a side effect also deposited sequences from unprocessed
mRNA and perhaps even genomic sequences into the EST databases.
Even outside of the random-primed projects, there is a
degree of non-mRNA contamination. Because of this, a
single unspliced EST should be viewed with considerable
skepticism.
</p>

<p>
To generate this track, rat ESTs from GenBank were aligned
against the genome using blat. Note that the maximum intron length
allowed by blat is 750,000 bases, which may eliminate some ESTs with very
long introns that might otherwise align. When a single
EST aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the
highest base identity was identified.  Only alignments having
a base identity level within 0.5% of the best and at least 96% base identity
with the genomic sequence were kept.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Geneid is a program to predict genes in anonymous genomic sequences designed
with a hierarchical structure. In the first step, splice sites, start and stop
codons are predicted and scored along the sequence using Position Weight Arrays
(PWAs). Next, exons are built from the sites. Exons are scored as the sum of the
scores of the defining sites, plus the the log-likelihood ratio of a
Markov Model for coding DNA. Finally, from the set of predicted exons, the gene
structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons.

46,intronEst,Spliced ESTs,Rat ESTs That Have Been Spliced,"<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alignments between rat expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/"" target=""_blank"">
GenBank</a> and the genome that show signs of splicing when
aligned against the genome. ESTs are single-read sequences, typically about
500 bases in length, that usually represent fragments of transcribed genes.
</p>

<p>
To be considered spliced, an EST must show
evidence of at least one canonical intron (i.e., the genomic
sequence between EST alignment blocks must be at least 32 bases in
length and have GT/AG ends). By requiring splicing, the level
of contamination in the EST databases is drastically reduced
at the expense of eliminating many genuine 3' ESTs.
For a display of all ESTs (including unspliced), see the
rat EST track.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
This track follows the display conventions for
<a href=""/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay"" target=""_blank"">
PSL alignment tracks</A>. In dense display mode, darker shading
indicates a larger number of aligned ESTs.
</p>

<p>
The strand information (+/-) indicates the
direction of the match between the EST and the matching
genomic sequence.  It bears no relationship to the direction
of transcription of the RNA with which it might be associated.
</p>

<p>
The description page for this track has a filter that can be used to change
the display mode, alter the color, and include/exclude a subset of items
within the track. This may be helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task.
</p>

<p>
To use the filter:
<ol>
<li>Type a term in one or more of the text boxes to filter the EST
display. For example, to apply the filter to all ESTs expressed in a specific
organ, type the name of the organ in the tissue box. To view the list of
valid terms for each text box, consult the table in the Table Browser that
corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For example, the
&quot;tissue&quot; table contains all the types of tissues that can be
entered into the tissue text box. Multiple terms may be entered at once,
separated by a space. Wildcards may also be used in the filter.</li>
<li>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only ESTs that match all filter
criteria will be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, ESTs that
match any one of the filter criteria will be highlighted.</li>
<li>Choose the color or display characteristic that should be used to
highlight or include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is
chosen, the browser will not display ESTs that match the filter criteria.
If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser will display only those
ESTs that match the filter criteria.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
This track may also be configured to display base labeling, a feature that
allows the user to display all bases in the aligning sequence or only those
that differ from the genomic sequence. For more information about this option,
go to the
<a href=""/goldenPath/help/hgBaseLabel.html"" target=""_blank"">
Base Coloring for Alignment Tracks</a> page.
Several types of alignment gap may also be colored;

</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
To make an EST, RNA is isolated from cells and reverse
transcribed into cDNA.  Typically, the cDNA is cloned
into a plasmid vector and a read is taken from the 5'
and/or 3' primer.  For most &mdash; but not all &mdash; ESTs, the
reverse transcription is primed by an oligo-dT, which
hybridizes with the poly-A tail of mature mRNA. The
reverse transcriptase may or may not make it to the 5'
end of the mRNA,  which may or may not be degraded.
</p>

<p>
In general, the 3' ESTs mark the end of transcription
reasonably well, but the 5' ESTs may end at any point
within the transcript.  Some of the newer cap-selected
libraries cover transcription start reasonably well. Before the
cap-selection techniques
emerged, some projects used random rather than poly-A
priming in an attempt to retrieve sequence distant from the
3' end.  These projects were successful at this, but as
a side effect also deposited sequences from unprocessed
mRNA and perhaps even genomic sequences into the EST databases.
Even outside of the random-primed projects, there is a
degree of non-mRNA contamination. Because of this, a
single unspliced EST should be viewed with considerable
skepticism.
</p>

<p>
To generate this track, rat ESTs from GenBank were aligned
against the genome using blat. Note that the maximum intron length
allowed by blat is 750,000 bases, which may eliminate some ESTs with very
long introns that might otherwise align. When a single
EST aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the
highest base identity was identified.  Only alignments having
a base identity level within 0.5% of the best and at least 96% base identity
with the genomic sequence are displayed in this track.

</p>

<p>
The detailed annotations from RepeatMasker are in the RepeatMasker track.  This
track shows fragments of original repeat insertions which have been interrupted
by insertions of younger repeats or through local rearrangements.  The fragments
are joined using the ID column of RepeatMasker output.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
In pack or full mode, each interrupted repeat is displayed as boxes
(fragments) joined by horizontal lines, labeled with the repeat name.
If all fragments are on the same strand, arrows are added to the
horizontal line to indicate the strand.  In dense or squish mode, labels
and arrows are omitted and in dense mode, all items are collapsed to
fit on a single row.
</p>

<p>
Items are shaded according to the average identity score of their
fragments.  Usually, the shade of an item is similar to the shades of
its fragments unless some fragments are much more diverged than
others.  The score displayed above is the average identity score,
clipped to a range of 50% - 100% and then mapped to the range
0 - 1000 for shading in the browser.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UCSC has used the most current versions of the RepeatMasker software
and repeat libraries available to generate these data. Note that these
versions may be newer than those that are publicly available on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
Data are generated using the RepeatMasker <em>-s</em> flag. Additional flags

<p>
The NCBI RefSeq Genes composite track shows rat protein-coding and non-protein-coding
genes taken from the NCBI RNA reference sequences collection (RefSeq). All subtracks use
coordinates provided by RefSeq, except for the <em>UCSC RefSeq</em> track, which UCSC produces by
realigning the RefSeq RNAs to the genome. This realignment may result in occasional differences
between the annotation coordinates provided by UCSC and NCBI. For RNA-seq analysis, we advise
using NCBI aligned tables like RefSeq All or RefSeq Curated. See the 
<a href=""#methods"">Methods</a> section for more details about how the different tracks were 
created. </p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track is a composite track that contains differing data sets.
To show only a selected set of subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks that you wish to 
hide. <b>Note:</b> Not all subtracts are available on all assemblies. </p>

The possible subtracks include:
<dl>
  <dt><em><strong>RefSeq aligned annotations and UCSC alignment of RefSeq annotations
          </strong></em></dt>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq All</em> &ndash; all curated and predicted annotations provided by 
    RefSeq.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Curated</em> &ndash; subset of <em>RefSeq All</em> that includes only those 
    annotations whose accessions begin with NM, NR,  NP or YP. <small>(NP and YP are used only for
    protein-coding genes on the mitochondrion; YP is used for human only.)</small></li>

   <li>
   <em>RefSeq Select+MANE (subset)</em> &ndash; Subset of RefSeq Curated, transcripts marked as 
   RefSeq Select or MANE Select. 
   A single <em>Select</em> transcript is chosen as representative for each protein-coding gene. 
   This track includes transcripts categorized as MANE, which are further agreed upon as 
   representative by both NCBI RefSeq and Ensembl/GENCODE, and have a 100% identical match 
   to a transcript in the Ensembl annotation. See <a target=""_blank"" 
   href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/refseq_select/"">NCBI RefSeq Select</a>. 
   Note that we provide a separate track, <a

   which contains only the MANE transcripts.
   </li>
   <li>
   <em>RefSeq HGMD (subset)</em> &ndash; Subset of RefSeq Curated, transcripts annotated by the Human
   Gene Mutation Database. This track is only available on the human genomes hg19 and hg38.

</ul>

<p>The <em>RefSeq Diffs</em> track contains five different types of inconsistency between the
reference genome sequence and the RefSeq transcript sequences. The five types of differences are
as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
   <em>mismatch</em> &ndash; aligned but mismatching bases, plus HGVS g. 
       to show the genomic change required to match the transcript and HGVS c./n. 
       to show the transcript change required to match the genome.</li>
  <li>
   <em>short gap</em> &ndash; genomic gaps that are too small to be introns (arbitrary cutoff of
	 &lt; 45 bp), most likely insertions/deletion variants or errors, with HGVS g. and c./n. 
	showing differences.</li>
  <li>
   <em>shift gap</em> &ndash; shortGap items whose placement could be shifted left and/or right on
	the genome due to repetitive sequence, with HGVS c./n. position range of ambiguous region 
	in transcript. Here, thin and thick lines are used -- the thin line shows the span of the
	repetitive sequence, and the thick line shows the rightmost shifted gap.
       </li>
  <li>
   <em>double gap</em> &ndash; genomic gaps that are long enough to be introns but that skip over 
	transcript sequence (invisible in default setting), with HGVS c./n. deletion.</li>
  <li>
   <em>skipped</em> &ndash; sequence at the beginning or end of a transcript that is not aligned to
       the genome
       (invisible in default setting), with HGVS c./n. deletion</li>

</ul>

<small><b>HGVS Terminology </b>(Human Genome Variation Society):

g. = genomic sequence ; c. = coding DNA sequence ; n. = non-coding RNA reference sequence.</small>
</p>

<p>
When reporting HGVS with RefSeq sequences, to make sure that results from
research articles can be mapped to the genome unambiguously, 
please specify the RefSeq annotation release displayed on the transcript's
Genome Browser details page and also the RefSeq transcript ID with version
(e.g. NM_012309.4 not NM_012309).

<a name=""methods""></a>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Tracks contained in the RefSeq annotation and RefSeq RNA alignment tracks were created at UCSC using 
data from the NCBI RefSeq project. Data files were downloaded from RefSeq in GFF file format and 
converted to the genePred and PSL table formats for display in the Genome Browser. Information about
the NCBI annotation pipeline can be found 
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The RefSeq Diffs track is generated by UCSC using NCBI's RefSeq RNA alignments.</p>
<p>
The UCSC RefSeq Genes track is constructed using the same methods as previous RefSeq Genes tracks.
RefSeq RNAs were aligned against the rat genome using BLAT. Those with an alignment of
less than 15% were discarded. When a single RNA aligned in multiple places, the alignment
having the highest base identity was identified. Only alignments having a base identity
level within 0.1% of the best and at least 96% base identity with the genomic sequence were
kept.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data for these tracks can be accessed in multiple ways. It can be explored interactively 
using the <a href=""../cgi-bin/hgTables"" target=""_blank"">Table Browser</a> or 
<a href=""../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator""
target=""_blank"">Data Integrator</a>. The tables can also be accessed programmatically through our
<a href=""../../goldenPath/help/mysql.html""
target=""_blank"">public MySQL server</a> or downloaded from our
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rn6/database/""
target=""_blank"">downloads server</a> for local processing. You can also access any RefSeq table
entries in JSON format through our <a href=""http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/api.html"">
JSON API</a>.</p>
<p>
The data in the <em>RefSeq Other</em> and <em>RefSeq Diffs</em> tracks are organized in 
<a href=""../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1.5"" target=""_blank"">bigBed</a> file format; more
information about accessing the information in this bigBed file can be found
below. The other subtracks are associated with database tables as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href=""../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format9"" target=""_blank"">genePred</a> format:</dt>
  <ul>
    <li>RefSeq All - <tt>ncbiRefSeq</tt></li>

  <ul>	
    <li>RefSeq Alignments - <tt>ncbiRefSeqPsl</tt></li>
  </ul>
</dl>
<p>
The first column of each of these tables is &quot;bin&quot;. This column is designed
to speed up access for display in the Genome Browser, but can be safely ignored in downstream
analysis. You can read more about the bin indexing system
<a href=""http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Bin_indexing_system"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The annotations in the <em>RefSeqOther</em> and <em>RefSeqDiffs</em> tracks are stored in bigBed 
files, which can be obtained from our downloads server here,
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/rn6/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqOther.bb""
target=""_blank""><tt>ncbiRefSeqOther.bb</tt></a> and 
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/rn6/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqGenomicDiff.bb"" 
target=""_blank""><tt>ncbiRefSeqDiffs.bb</tt></a>.
Individual regions or the whole set of genome-wide annotations can be obtained using our tool
<tt>bigBedToBed</tt> which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system from the utilities directory linked below. For example, to extract only
annotations in a given region, you could use the following command:</p>
<p>
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/rn6/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqOther.bb
-chrom=chr16 -start=34990190 -end=36727467 stdout</tt></p>
<p>
You can download a GTF format version of the RefSeq All table from the 
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rn6/bigZips/genes/"">GTF downloads directory</a>.
The genePred format tracks can also be converted to GTF format using the
<tt>genePredToGtf</tt> utility, available from the
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/""
target=""_blank"">utilities directory</a> on the UCSC downloads 
server. The utility can be run from the command line like so:</p>
<tt>genePredToGtf rn6 ncbiRefSeqPredicted ncbiRefSeqPredicted.gtf</tt>
<p>
Note that using genePredToGtf in this manner accesses our public MySQL server, and you therefore 
must set up your hg.conf as described on the MySQL page linked near the beginning of the Data Access
section.</p>
<p>

81,rmsk,RepeatMasker,Repeating Elements by RepeatMasker,"<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track was created by using Arian Smit's
<a href=""http://www.repeatmasker.org/"" target=""_blank"">RepeatMasker</a>
program, which screens DNA sequences
for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The program
outputs a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the
query sequence (represented by this track), as well as a modified version
of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked
(generally available on the
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html""
target=_blank>Downloads</a> page). RepeatMasker uses the
<a href=""https://www.girinst.org/repbase/update/index.html""
target=_blank>Repbase Update</a> library of repeats from the
<a href=""https://www.girinst.org/"" target=_blank>Genetic 
Information Research Institute</a> (GIRI).
Repbase Update is described in Jurka (2000) in the References section below.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
In full display mode, this track displays up to ten different classes of repeats:
<ul>
<li>Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE), which include ALUs</li>
<li>Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE)</li>
<li>Long terminal repeat elements (LTR), which include retroposons</li>
<li>DNA repeat elements (DNA)</li>
<li>Simple repeats (micro-satellites)</li>
<li>Low complexity repeats</li>
<li>Satellite repeats</li>
<li>RNA repeats (including RNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, scRNA, srpRNA)</li>
<li>Other repeats, which includes class RC (Rolling Circle)</li>
<li>Unknown</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The level of color shading in the graphical display reflects the amount of
base mismatch, base deletion, and base insertion associated with a repeat
element. The higher the combined number of these, the lighter the shading.
</p>

<p>
A &quot;?&quot; at the end of the &quot;Family&quot; or &quot;Class&quot; (for example, DNA?) signifies that
the curator was unsure of the classification. At some point in the future,
either the &quot;?&quot; will be removed or the classification will be changed.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Data are generated using the RepeatMasker <em>-s</em> flag. Additional flags
may be used for certain organisms.  Repeats are soft-masked. Alignments may
extend through repeats, but are not permitted to initiate in them.
See the <a href=""/FAQ/FAQdownloads#download16"" target=""_blank"">FAQ</a> for more information.

This track is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and

<p>
This track shows the genomic positions of natural and artifical amino acid variants
in the <a href=""https://www.uniprot.org/"" target=""_blank"">UniProt/SwissProt</A> database.
The data has been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt staff.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt variants are labeled with the amino acid
change at a given position and, if known, the abbreviated disease name. A
&quot;?&quot; is used if there is no disease annotated at this location, but the
protein is described as being linked to only a single disease in UniProt.
</p>

<p>
Mouse over a mutation to see the UniProt comments.
</p>

<p>
Artificially-introduced mutations are colored green and naturally-occurring variants are colored
red. For full information about a particular variant, click the &quot;UniProt variant&quot; linkout.  
The &quot;UniProt record&quot; linkout lists all variants of a particular protein sequence.
The &quot;Source articles&quot; linkout lists the articles in PubMed that originally described
the variant(s) and were used as evidence by the UniProt curators.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UniProt sequences were aligned to RefSeq sequences first with BLAT, then lifted
to genome positions with pslMap.  UniProt variants were parsed from the UniProt
XML file.  The variants were then mapped to the genome through the alignment
using the pslMap program.  This mapping approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF=""http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/""
TARGET=""_BLANK"">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans. The complete script is
part of the kent source tree and is located in src/hg/utils/uniprotMutations.

<P>
This track contains GENCODE or Ensembl alignments produced by
the <em>TransMap</em> cross-species alignment algorithm from other vertebrate
species in the UCSC Genome Browser.  GENCODE is Ensembl for human and mouse,
for other Ensembl sources, only ones with full gene builds are used.
Projection Ensembl gene annotations will not be used as sources.
For closer evolutionary distances, the alignments are created using
syntenically filtered BLASTZ alignment chains, resulting in a prediction of the
orthologous genes in rat.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
  <ol>
    <li> Source transcript alignments were obtained from vertebrate organisms
    in the UCSC Genome Browser Database. BLAT alignments of RefSeq Genes, GenBank 
    mRNAs, and GenBank Spliced ESTs to the cognate genome, along with UCSC Genes,
    were used as available.
    <li> For all vertebrate assemblies that had BLASTZ alignment chains and
      nets to the rat (rn6) genome, a subset of the alignment chains were
      selected as follows:
      <ul>
      <li> For organisms whose branch distance was no more than 0.5
        (as computed by <tt>phyloFit</tt>, see Conservation track description for details),
        syntenic filtering was used.  Reciprocal best nets were used if available;
        otherwise, nets were selected with the <tt>netfilter -syn</tt> command.
        The chains corresponding to the selected nets were used for mapping.
      <li> For more distant species, where the determination of synteny is difficult,
        the full set of chains was used for mapping. This allows for more genes to
        map at the expense of some mapping to paralogous regions.  The
        post-alignment filtering step removes some of the duplications.
    </ul>
    <li> The <tt>pslMap</tt> program was used to do a base-level projection of
      the source transcript alignments via the selected chains
      to the rat genome, resulting in pairwise alignments of the source transcripts to
      the genome.
    <li> The resulting alignments were filtered with <tt>pslCDnaFilter</tt>
      with a global near-best criteria of 0.5% in finished genomes
      (human and mouse) and 1.0% in other genomes.  Alignments
      where less than 20% of the transcript mapped were discarded.
  </ol>
</P>

<P>
To ensure unique identifiers for each alignment, cDNA and gene accessions were
made unique by appending a suffix for each location in the source genome and
again for each mapped location in the destination genome.  The format is:
<pre>
   accession.version-srcUniq.destUniq
</pre>

Where <tt>srcUniq</tt> is a number added to make each source alignment unique, and
<tt>destUniq</tt> is added to give the subsequent TransMap alignments unique
identifiers.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the cow genome, there are two alignments of mRNA <tt>BC149621.1</tt>.
These are assigned the identifiers <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>.
When these are mapped to the human genome, <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> maps to a single
location and is given the identifier <tt>BC149621.1-1.1</tt>.  However, <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>
maps to two locations, resulting in <tt>BC149621.1-2.1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2.2</tt>.  Note
that multiple TransMap mappings are usually the result of tandem duplications, where both
chains are identified as syntenic.

        The chains corresponding to the selected nets were used for mapping.
      <li> For more distant species, where the determination of synteny is difficult,
        the full set of chains was used for mapping. This allows for more genes to
        map at the expense of some mapping to paralogous regions.  The
        post-alignment filtering step removes some of the duplications.
    </ul>
    <li> The <tt>pslMap</tt> program was used to do a base-level projection of
      the source transcript alignments via the selected chains
      to the rat genome, resulting in pairwise alignments of the source transcripts to
      the genome.
    <li> The resulting alignments were filtered with <tt>pslCDnaFilter</tt>
      with a global near-best criteria of 0.5% in finished genomes
      (human and mouse) and 1.0% in other genomes.  Alignments
      where less than 20% of the transcript mapped were discarded.
  </ol>
</P>

<P>
To ensure unique identifiers for each alignment, cDNA and gene accessions were
made unique by appending a suffix for each location in the source genome and
again for each mapped location in the destination genome.  The format is:
<pre>
   accession.version-srcUniq.destUniq
</pre>

Where <tt>srcUniq</tt> is a number added to make each source alignment unique, and
<tt>destUniq</tt> is added to give the subsequent TransMap alignments unique
identifiers.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the cow genome, there are two alignments of mRNA <tt>BC149621.1</tt>.
These are assigned the identifiers <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>.
When these are mapped to the human genome, <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> maps to a single
location and is given the identifier <tt>BC149621.1-1.1</tt>.  However, <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>
maps to two locations, resulting in <tt>BC149621.1-2.1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2.2</tt>.  Note
that multiple TransMap mappings are usually the result of tandem duplications, where both
chains are identified as syntenic.

      where less than 20% of the transcript mapped were discarded.
  </ol>
</P>

<P>
To ensure unique identifiers for each alignment, cDNA and gene accessions were
made unique by appending a suffix for each location in the source genome and
again for each mapped location in the destination genome.  The format is:
<pre>
   accession.version-srcUniq.destUniq
</pre>

Where <tt>srcUniq</tt> is a number added to make each source alignment unique, and
<tt>destUniq</tt> is added to give the subsequent TransMap alignments unique
identifiers.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the cow genome, there are two alignments of mRNA <tt>BC149621.1</tt>.
These are assigned the identifiers <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>.
When these are mapped to the human genome, <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> maps to a single
location and is given the identifier <tt>BC149621.1-1.1</tt>.  However, <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>
maps to two locations, resulting in <tt>BC149621.1-2.1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2.2</tt>.  Note
that multiple TransMap mappings are usually the result of tandem duplications, where both
chains are identified as syntenic.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
  <ol>
    <li> Source transcript alignments were obtained from vertebrate organisms
    in the UCSC Genome Browser Database. BLAT alignments of RefSeq Genes, GenBank 
    mRNAs, and GenBank Spliced ESTs to the cognate genome, along with UCSC Genes,
    were used as available.
    <li> For all vertebrate assemblies that had BLASTZ alignment chains and
      nets to the rat (rn6) genome, a subset of the alignment chains were
      selected as follows:
      <ul>
      <li> For organisms whose branch distance was no more than 0.5
        (as computed by <tt>phyloFit</tt>, see Conservation track description for details),
        syntenic filtering was used.  Reciprocal best nets were used if available;
        otherwise, nets were selected with the <tt>netfilter -syn</tt> command.
        The chains corresponding to the selected nets were used for mapping.
      <li> For more distant species, where the determination of synteny is difficult,
        the full set of chains was used for mapping. This allows for more genes to
        map at the expense of some mapping to paralogous regions.  The
        post-alignment filtering step removes some of the duplications.
    </ul>
    <li> The <tt>pslMap</tt> program was used to do a base-level projection of
      the source transcript alignments via the selected chains
      to the rat genome, resulting in pairwise alignments of the source transcripts to
      the genome.
    <li> The resulting alignments were filtered with <tt>pslCDnaFilter</tt>
      with a global near-best criteria of 0.5% in finished genomes
      (human and mouse) and 1.0% in other genomes.  Alignments
      where less than 20% of the transcript mapped were discarded.
  </ol>

<P>
To ensure unique identifiers for each alignment, cDNA and gene accessions were
made unique by appending a suffix for each location in the source genome and

<pre>

</pre>

Where <tt>srcUniq</tt> is a number added to make each source alignment unique, and
<tt>destUniq</tt> is added to give the subsequent TransMap alignments unique
identifiers.

For example, in the cow genome, there are two alignments of mRNA <tt>BC149621.1</tt>.

These tracks contain cDNA and gene alignments produced by

from other vertebrate species in the UCSC Genome Browser.
For closer evolutionary distances, the alignments are created using
syntenically filtered LASTZ or BLASTZ alignment chains, resulting

organisms, reciprocal best alignments are used.
</P>

<em>TransMap</em> maps genes and related annotations in one species to another
using synteny-filtered pairwise genome alignments (chains and nets) to
determine the most likely orthologs.  For example, for the mRNA TransMap track
on the human assembly, more than 400,000 mRNAs from 25 vertebrate species were
aligned at high stringency to the native assembly using BLAT.  The alignments
were then mapped to the human assembly using the chain and net alignments
produced using blastz, which has higher sensitivity than BLAT for diverged
organisms.
<P>
Compared to translated BLAT, TransMap finds fewer paralogs and aligns more UTR
bases.

   accession.version-srcUniq.destUniq
</pre>

Where <tt>srcUniq</tt> is a number added to make each source alignment unique, and
<tt>destUniq</tt> is added to give the subsequent TransMap alignments unique
identifiers.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the cow genome, there are two alignments of mRNA <tt>BC149621.1</tt>.
These are assigned the identifiers <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>.
When these are mapped to the human genome, <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> maps to a single
location and is given the identifier <tt>BC149621.1-1.1</tt>.  However, <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>
maps to two locations, resulting in <tt>BC149621.1-2.1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2.2</tt>.  Note
that multiple TransMap mappings are usually the result of tandem duplications, where both
chains are identified as syntenic.

These tracks contain cDNA and gene alignments produced by

For closer evolutionary distances, the alignments are created using
syntenically filtered LASTZ or BLASTZ alignment chains, resulting

</P>

<em>TransMap</em> maps genes and related annotations in one species to another
using synteny-filtered pairwise genome alignments (chains and nets) to
determine the most likely orthologs.  For example, for the mRNA TransMap track
on the human assembly, more than 400,000 mRNAs from 25 vertebrate species were
aligned at high stringency to the native assembly using BLAT.  The alignments
were then mapped to the human assembly using the chain and net alignments
produced using BLASTZ, which has higher sensitivity than BLAT for diverged
organisms.
<P>
Compared to translated BLAT, TransMap finds fewer paralogs and aligns more UTR
bases.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
  <ol>
    <li> Source transcript alignments were obtained from vertebrate organisms
    in the UCSC Genome Browser Database. BLAT alignments of RefSeq Genes, GenBank 
    mRNAs, and GenBank Spliced ESTs to the cognate genome, along with UCSC Genes,
    were used as available.
    <li> For all vertebrate assemblies that had BLASTZ alignment chains and
      nets to the rat (rn6) genome, a subset of the alignment chains were
      selected as follows:
      <ul>
      <li> For organisms whose branch distance was no more than 0.5
        (as computed by <tt>phyloFit</tt>, see Conservation track description for details),
        syntenic filtering was used.  Reciprocal best nets were used if available;
        otherwise, nets were selected with the <tt>netfilter -syn</tt> command.
        The chains corresponding to the selected nets were used for mapping.
      <li> For more distant species, where the determination of synteny is difficult,
        the full set of chains was used for mapping. This allows for more genes to
        map at the expense of some mapping to paralogous regions.  The
        post-alignment filtering step removes some of the duplications.
    </ul>
    <li> The <tt>pslMap</tt> program was used to do a base-level projection of
      the source transcript alignments via the selected chains
      to the rat genome, resulting in pairwise alignments of the source transcripts to
      the genome.
    <li> The resulting alignments were filtered with <tt>pslCDnaFilter</tt>
      with a global near-best criteria of 0.5% in finished genomes
      (human and mouse) and 1.0% in other genomes.  Alignments
      where less than 20% of the transcript mapped were discarded.
  </ol>
</P>

<P>
To ensure unique identifiers for each alignment, cDNA and gene accessions were
made unique by appending a suffix for each location in the source genome and
again for each mapped location in the destination genome.  The format is:
<pre>
   accession.version-srcUniq.destUniq
</pre>

Where <tt>srcUniq</tt> is a number added to make each source alignment unique, and
<tt>destUniq</tt> is added to give the subsequent TransMap alignments unique
identifiers.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the cow genome, there are two alignments of mRNA <tt>BC149621.1</tt>.
These are assigned the identifiers <tt>BC149621.1-1</tt> and <tt>BC149621.1-2</tt>.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt annotations are labeled with a short name for
the type of annotation (e.g. &quot;glyco&quot;, &quot;disulf bond&quot;, &quot;Signal peptide&quot;
etc.). A click on them shows the full annotation and provides a link to the UniProt/SwissProt
record for more details. TrEMBL annotations are always shown in 
<span style=""color: rgb(0,150,250)""><b>light blue</b></span>, except in the Signal Peptides,
Extracellular Domains, Transmembrane Domains, and Cytoplamsic domains subtracks.</p>

<p>
Mouse over a feature to see the full UniProt annotation comment. For variants, the mouse over will
show the full name of the UniProt disease acronym.
</p>

<p>
The subtracks for domains related to subcellular location are sorted from outside to inside of 
the cell: <span style=""color: rgb(255,0,150)""><b>Signal peptide</b></span>, 
<span style=""color: rgb(0,150,255)""><b>extracellular</b></span>, <span style=""color: rgb(0,150,0)"">
<b>transmembrane</b></span>, and <span style=""color: rgb(255,150,0)""><b>cytoplasmic</b></span>.
</p>

<p>
In the &quot;UniProt Modifications&quot; track, lipoification sites are highlighted in 
<span style=""color: rgb(12,12,120)""><b>dark blue</b></span>, glycosylation sites in 
<span style=""color: rgb(0,100,100)""><b>dark green</b></span>, and phosphorylation in 
<span style=""color: rgb(200,200,0)""><b>light green</b></span>.</p>

<p>
Duplicate annotations are removed as far as possible: if a TrEMBL annotation
has the same genome position and same feature type, comment, disease and
mutated amino acids as a SwissProt annotation, it is not shown again. Two
annotations mapped through different transcripts but with the same genome
coordinates are only shown once.  </p>

<p>Note that only for the human hg38 assembly and SwissProt annotations, there
also is a <a
href=""hgTracks?db=hg38&hubUrl=ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/genome_annotation_tracks/UP000005640_9606_hub/hub.txt"">public
track hub</a> prepared by UniProt itself, with 
genome annotations maintained by UniProt using their own mapping
method based on those Gencode/Ensembl gene models that are annotated in UniProt
for a given protein.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UniProt sequences were aligned to UCSC/Gencode transcript sequences first with
BLAT, filtered with pslReps (93% query coverage, within top 1% score), lifted
to genome positions with pslMap and filtered again.  UniProt annotations were
obtained from the UniProt XML file.  The annotations were then mapped to the
genome through the alignment using the pslMap program.  This mapping approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF=""http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/""
TARGET=""_BLANK"">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans. For human and mouse, the
alignments were filtered by retaining only proteins annotated with
a given transcript in the Genome Browser table kgXref. Like all Genome Browser
source code, the main script used to build this track can be found on 
<a href=""https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/tree/master/src/hg/utils/otto/uniprot/doUniprot"">github</a>.

<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href=""../cgi-bin/hgTables"">Table Browser</a>, or the
<a href=""../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator"">Data Integrator</a>.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that 
can be downloaded from the
<a href=""http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/rn6/uniprot/"" target=""_blank"">download server</a>.
The exact filenames can be found in the 
<a href=""https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/trackDb.uniprot.ra"">track configuration file</a>. 
Annotations can be converted to ASCII text by our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found

mapped to genomic coordinates. It also shows how the protein sequences in this database

The data has been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt/SwissProt staff.
The annotations are divided into multiple subtracks, based on their &quot;feature type&quot; in UniProt:

<H3>Chain Track</H3>
<P>
The chain track shows alignments of rat (Jul. 2014 (RGSC 6.0/rn6)) to
other genomes using a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps 
than traditional affine gap scoring systems. It can also tolerate gaps in both
rat and the other genome simultaneously. These 
&quot;double-sided&quot; gaps can be caused by local inversions and 
overlapping deletions in both species. 
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.
Single lines indicate gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the
rat assembly or an insertion in the other assembly.
Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both species. This may result from inversions, overlapping
deletions, an abundance of local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one
species.  In cases where multiple chains align over a particular region of
the other genome, the chains with single-lined gaps are often 
due to processed pseudogenes, while chains with double-lined gaps are more 
often due to paralogs and unprocessed pseudogenes.</P> 
<P>
In the &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;full&quot; display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.</P>

<H3>Net Track</H3>
<P>
The net track shows the best rat/other chain for 
every part of the other genome. It is useful for
finding orthologous regions and for studying genome
rearrangement.  The rat sequence used in this annotation is from
the Jul. 2014 (RGSC 6.0/rn6) assembly.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<H3>Chain Track</H3>
<P>By default, the chains to chromosome-based assemblies are colored
based on which chromosome they map to in the aligning organism. To turn
off the coloring, check the &quot;off&quot; button next to: Color
track based on chromosome.</P>
<P>
To display only the chains of one chromosome in the aligning
organism, enter the name of that chromosome (e.g. chr4) in box next to: 
Filter by chromosome.</P>

<H3>Net Track</H3>
<P>
In full display mode, the top-level (level 1)
chains are the largest, highest-scoring chains that
span this region.  In many cases gaps exist in the
top-level chain.  When possible, these are filled in by
other chains that are displayed at level 2.  The gaps in 
level 2 chains may be filled by level 3 chains and so
forth. </P>
<P>
In the graphical display, the boxes represent ungapped 
alignments; the lines represent gaps.  Click
on a box to view detailed information about the chain
as a whole; click on a line to display information
about the gap.  The detailed information is useful in determining
the cause of the gap or, for lower level chains, the genomic
rearrangement. </P> 
<P> 
Individual items in the display are categorized as one of four types
(other than gap):</P>
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Top</B> - the best, longest match. Displayed on level 1.
<LI><B>Syn</B> - line-ups on the same chromosome as the gap in the level above
it.
<LI><B>Inv</B> - a line-up on the same chromosome as the gap above it, but in 
the opposite orientation.
<LI><B>NonSyn</B> - a match to a chromosome different from the gap in the 
level above.
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<H3>Chain track</H3>
<P>
Transposons that have been inserted since the rat/other
split were removed from the assemblies. The abbreviated genomes were
aligned with lastz, and the transposons were added back in.
The resulting alignments were converted into axt format using the lavToAxt
program. The axt alignments were fed into axtChain, which organizes all
alignments between a single rat chromosome and a single
chromosome from the other genome into a group and creates a kd-tree out
of the gapless subsections (blocks) of the alignments. A dynamic program
was then run over the kd-trees to find the maximally scoring chains of these
blocks.

TARGET=_blank>minimum score and gap</A> parameters used in these alignments.
</P>

<H3>Net track</H3>
<P>
Chains were derived from lastz alignments, using the methods
described on the chain tracks description pages, and sorted with the 
highest-scoring chains in the genome ranked first. The program
chainNet was then used to place the chains one at a time, trimming them as 
necessary to fit into sections not already covered by a higher-scoring chain. 
During this process, a natural hierarchy emerged in which a chain that filled 
a gap in a higher-scoring chain was placed underneath that chain. The program 
netSyntenic was used to fill in information about the relationship between 
higher- and lower-level chains, such as whether a lower-level
chain was syntenic or inverted relative to the higher-level chain. 
The program netClass was then used to fill in how much of the gaps and chains 
contained <em>N</em>s (sequencing gaps) in one or both species and how much
was filled with transposons inserted before and after the two organisms 
diverged.</P>

<p>
This track displays translated blat alignments of vertebrate and
invertebrate mRNA in
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/"" target=""_blank"">
GenBank</a> from organisms other than rat.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
This track follows the display conventions for
<a href=""../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay"" target=""_blank"">
PSL alignment tracks</a>. In dense display mode, the items that
are more darkly shaded indicate matches of better quality.
</p>

<p>
The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match (here always 5' to 3', hence +).
The second + or - indicates the orientation of the matching
translated genomic sequence. Because the two orientations of a DNA
sequence give different predicted protein sequences, there are four
combinations.  ++ is not the same as --, nor is +- the same as -+.
</p>

<p>
The description page for this track has a filter that can be used to change
the display mode, alter the color, and include/exclude a subset of items
within the track. This may be helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task.
</p>

<p>
To use the filter:
<ol>
<li>Type a term in one or more of the text boxes to filter the mRNA
display. For example, to apply the filter to all mRNAs expressed in a specific
organ, type the name of the organ in the tissue box. To view the list of
valid terms for each text box, consult the table in the Table Browser that
corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For example, the
&quot;tissue&quot; table contains all the types of tissues that can be
entered into the tissue text box. Multiple terms may be entered at once,
separated by a space. Wildcards may also be used in the filter.</li>
<li>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only mRNAs that match all filter
criteria will be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, mRNAs that
match any one of the filter criteria will be highlighted.</li>
<li>Choose the color or display characteristic that should be used to
highlight or include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is
chosen, the browser will not display mRNAs that match the filter criteria.
If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser will display only those
mRNAs that match the filter criteria.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
This track may also be configured to display codon coloring, a feature that
allows the user to quickly compare mRNAs against the genomic sequence. For more
information about this option, go to the
<a href=""../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoringMrna.html"" target=""_blank"">
Codon and Base Coloring for Alignment Tracks</a> page.
Several types of alignment gap may also be colored;
for more information, go to the
<a href=""../goldenPath/help/hgIndelDisplay.html"" target=""_blank"">
Alignment Insertion/Deletion Display Options</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The mRNAs were aligned against the rat genome using translated blat.
When a single mRNA aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the
highest base identity was found.  Only those alignments having a base
identity level within 1% of the best and at least 25% base identity with the
genomic sequence were kept.

The mRNA track was produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
submitted to the international public sequence databases by
scientists worldwide.
